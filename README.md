# opencv-experiments
fucking about with opencv to process images instead of opening lightroom/whatever.

You will need opencv and probably pil/pillow to try these. 

Each program has an associated blog post, I'll list them all below. If the blog post 404's, its probably not "published" yet.

- redblueflip.py - flips the red and blue channels in an image file, for creating "false colour" images from photos taken with an IR/NIR modified camera.   
   see: www.fullspectrum.dev/false-colour-nir-images-first-attempts/ - Date: May 12, 2023.

- facefinder.py (not published yet) (playing with face detection, nothing exciting)

- catselfie.py (not published yet) (apparently you can face detect cats. attempts at an automatic cat selfie camera on RPi)

- sufficientdiff.py (not published yet) (only capture a frame if its 'n' different from a previous frame?)

- autolapse.py (not published yet) (tries automatically do timelapse shit on a 'static' scene like a plant growing, petri dish, etc)
